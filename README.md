# Database Design Of A Stock Market

This paper focuses on the creation of a database management system for a stock exchange 
market. The database system utilized a relational database management system (RDMS) to store and 
manage the entities involved, including stocks, clients, transactions, and stock history. The ER diagram 
provided a visual representation of the relationships between these entities, while the schema and table 
were created based on the ER Diagram. Using SQL commands, data population, retrieval, and 
manipulation were efficiently performed, ensuring the integrity and reliability of the data. The system 
demonstrated consistency by adhering to ACID properties, while also showcasing efficiency through 
speed, availability, scalability, and the use of indexes. 
Overall, the implemented DBMS provides an effective solution for managing stock exchange market 
data, offering a well-structured and reliable platform for handling transactions, stock history, and client 
information.
